# Notes from the lab computer (only the lab computer writes this file; requests come in `../QUEUE.md`)

The cell as measured, the plan for it and the commands are in `README.md` beside this file. This file adds what the
program does not log, run by run.

## The cell on 2026-10-22, before the first run

- **Stack height** (flange face to the HEX-E's tool face). Not measured with calipers tonight. The plan keeps the data
  sheet's 35.0 mm. The owner's 2 mm checks bound the error to well under 1 mm: at the poses this height gives, the pad's
  contact point stood "About 2 mm, centred" above both the sphere and the rod.
- **Placement as set.** The 2x4 was turned end for end at 18:27, so the keys stand toward the robot. It is clamped at
  both ends on the cutting-mat table. The sphere's base is at (−138.5, −595.6, 70.8) mm, yaw −92.3 deg, and the rod's
  at (−289.5, −585.5, 70.3) mm, yaw −94.1 deg, from hand seatings on the keys at 18:33 and 18:40. The plan's placement
  is the sphere's.
- **The mount's turn** about the tool axis is −92.15 deg from the flange's x (palmar along the flange's −y), so the
  plan's T_EM carries it. The workstation's plans of the 20th to 22nd assumed 0 deg (x_M on tool0's x). A plan built
  without `--mount-turn=-92.15` fails homing's tilt check by about 90 deg on this robot.
- **Cables**, from the owner's photos of 18:2x. The HEX-E's cable leaves the sensor's top and hangs to the table
  beside the wrist. The board's USB cable runs from the QT Py on the dorsal side, down past the mount, with a loose
  loop. Neither was re-routed tonight; the dry run will show whether the turns pull on them.
- **The operator saw** (owner, by eye): both 2 mm gaps right and centred. While the robot stood still, nothing touched
  and no load came on: no HEX-E change over 1 N.
- **HEX-E.** It answered at 192.168.0.6. Its untared Fz drifted from 627.7 N (18:10) to 645.1 N (18:55) in one pose,
  likely warm-up after the box's power cycle at about 17:50. Every datagram's status word is 0x40000, the box's
  "overload warning".
- **Board.** Five chips stream at 369 records/s. The browser viewer's calibration at 18:13 found the poles + + / + / + +
  (tip end first), 0.34 of N52, the pad 0.24 mm off its seat, rms 0.48 mT (the next pattern 0.79).
- **Speed slider** at 30 % from 19:0x, set over RTDE.

## Runs

### 19:27, first (preflight, homing, gravity, mount) at 30 %: stopped in gravity when the HEX-E dropped out

Folder `20261022-192715-first/`: the session folder, the printout and two overhead frames.

- Preflight passed. The HEX-E answered at 100 Hz with filter 3. Its noise was 0.044, 0.016 and 0.230 N, and 0.0029,
  0.0038 and 0.0011 N m, with no timed-out or late reads. The board streamed 360 records/s and the robot 124 Hz.
- Homing from the sphere seating put the indenter at (−139.0, −595.6, 71.1) mm, yaw −92.3 deg, tilt 0.71 deg.
- Gravity: grav-00 to grav-03 ended ok. At 19:27:40.4 the stream stopped for 7.2 s while joint 6 turned through 69 deg
  at 6.5 deg/s. The DAQ's sample counter then restarted (13702, then 102), and the sensor came back untared at Fz
  645.5 N. grav-02 and grav-03 were read with that offset, so this sweep gives no fit.
- At 19:28:24.6 the stream stopped again, with joint 6 at 23.5 deg turning at −6.9 deg/s, for about 2 min. grav-04 to
  grav-06 aborted with no sample for 100 ms, and the program stopped after three aborts in a row (19:29:21).
- The DAQ box answered ping throughout, and the board's stream had no gap over 100 ms. The DAQ's status word read 0
  while the sensor was tared and 0x40000 after the restart, so the "overload warning" bit follows the untared offset.
- The robot was left at grav-06's orientation, the flange at (−133, −512, 365) mm, in normal mode. Joint 6 runs from
  −118 to +167 deg in this sweep. The owner was asked to check the HEX-E's cable, its two connectors and its slack for
  those turns.

## The lab clone and git-lfs

The rebase at 19:21 replaced the plan, `poses.jsonl`, `moves.jsonl` and the images of this folder with git-lfs pointers,
because `.lfsconfig` skips LFS content. The program then failed to read the plan (19:26, nothing moved). The files came
back from the local LFS store, identical to the originals in `logs/20261022-ur5_homing_by_hand/`. This clone now has
`lfs.fetchexclude` cleared in `.git/config`, as the workstation's has, and `tipcal_run.sh` refuses to start on a pointer.
