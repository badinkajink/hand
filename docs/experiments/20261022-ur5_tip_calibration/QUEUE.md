# Requests between the workstation and the lab computer for the UR5 calibration of the fingertip

The owner set up two Claude Code sessions on 2026-10-22. The session on the lab computer runs the calibration of
`README.md` and pushes each run's data to GitHub. The session on the workstation polls GitHub every 30 s, analyses each
push and asks for further runs in this file. Only the workstation writes this file. The lab session answers in its
commit messages and in `lab/NOTES.md`, which only the lab writes, so no file is edited on both computers.

## What the lab computer pushes

1. Pull before each commit: `git pull --rebase origin main`. The pull brings this file, new plans and the
   `.gitattributes` rule that stores `docs/**/*.bin` in Git LFS. Without the rule, the `ft.bin` of a full session
   (about 130 MB) exceeds GitHub's limit of 100 MB a file, and the push is refused.
2. After every run of the program (`preflight`, `first`, `dry`, `sphere1` and each resume), copy its session folder
   whole to `lab/<YYYYMMDD>-<time>-<name>/` in this folder. The folder has `events.jsonl`, `registration.json`,
   `touches.json`, `pivots.json`, `session.json`, `plan.json` and the three streams `ft.bin`, `robot.bin` and
   `board.bin`. Add the program's printout: `tmux capture-pane -p -t tipcal -S -5000 > printout.txt`.
3. During `sphere1`, push the small files once more when the register and pivot stages have printed (all but the
   three streams). The registration is then checked here while the grid runs.
4. Write in `lab/NOTES.md` what the program does not log: the caliper reading of the stack from the flange face to the
   HEX-E's tool face (35.0 mm in the plan), the placement as set, the cable routing, what the operator saw or heard,
   and the start time of each run.
5. Give the commit message the run's name and outcome in one line, for example "UR5 lab: first (preflight, homing,
   gravity, mount): gravity 1.74 N, onsets within 0.4 mm".

## Plans written on the workstation

A new plan goes into `plan/` with its date and purpose in the file name. Plans are JSON, which this repository stores in
LFS, and the lab clone skips LFS content (`.lfsconfig`). Fetch one with
`git -c lfs.fetchexclude= lfs pull --include=docs/experiments/20261022-ur5_tip_calibration/plan/<file>`. A new plan runs
in the simulator before it runs on the robot (README rule 2): `$PY $P --plan <file> --sim --name sim-<name>`.

## Requests

Each request names what to run, why, and the result that would change the next step. Its status changes here when the
push that answers it arrives.

- R1 (standing, 2026-10-22 19:30). Push the session folder of every run as above, beginning with `first`. The workstation
  compares each with Table 2 of the README and with the simulated session 151114-sim, and answers here within about
  10 minutes of the push. First answered by `lab/20261022-192715-first/` (ffc6ed71).

- R2 (done by the lab in 20bfc6e7, 19:40, by another route). A stream gap over 0.5 s aborts the action it falls in
  and is logged as `ft_gap`. An orientation read after a lost tare makes the sweep's residual exceed 0.1 N, which stops
  the session before any contact, and the resume re-tares the HEX-E and sweeps again whole. The offsets per restart
  proposed below are therefore not needed. The request as written at 19:38: make the HEX-E's restarts visible, and keep
  the gravity fit through one. In `first` the stream stopped for 7.22 s (19:27:40.36 to 19:27:47.59) while joint 6 turned from 69.0 deg
  at 5.1 deg/s. The DAQ's sample counter then went from 13702 to 102, and the readings came back 645.2 N higher in Fz
  with status 0x40000. grav-02 and grav-03 ended ok with that offset, so the sweep mixed two zeros. The change proposed:
  1. `OptoForceStream` counts a restart when a sequence number is lower than the one before, and the session logs an
     event `ft_restart` with its time, the sequence numbers before and after, and the status after.
  2. `check_ft` aborts an action during which the restart count changed, with the reason "HEX-E restarted".
  3. `stage_gravity` stores the restart count in each record, and `fit_gravity` fits one offset per count. A restart
     then costs only the orientation it interrupts.

  Test it in the simulator with a restart injected (a 7 s gap, then an offset step) once during gravity and once
  during a press. The presses already abort on such a step, through the 10 N limit, so their data are safe without
  the change.

- R3 (implemented 19:59 in the builder, see the end of this item; the plan, before the next run). Order each stage's
  actions by joint 6. Solved as the
  program solves them (IK nearest the homing joints, joint 6 at 1.8 deg), this plan turns joint 6 through about
  4,300 deg in all, and every turn moves the HEX-E's cable:

  | Stage | Actions | Joint 6 span (deg) | Travel in plan order (deg) | Travel sorted (deg) | Steps over 90 deg |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Gravity | 12 | -178 to 122 | 989 | 300 | 2 |
  | Pad | 32 | -65 to 72 | 1425 | 137 | 6 |
  | Grid | 74 | -65 to 72 | 1062 | 137 | 1 |
  | Final gravity | 4 | -178 to 62 | 460 | 240 | 2 |
  | Mount, pivot, shear, roll, twist, final | 27 | -62 to 26 | 367 | 367 | 0 |

  Sorted by joint 6, the same actions need about 1,300 deg. The flank touch-offs alternate sides, so the pad stage
  turns 130 deg six times. The robot's own IK put grav-03 at +166.6 deg, 22.8 deg off its target orientation (the fit
  uses the reached orientation), so grav-03 to grav-04 turned 285 deg. The builder's clearance checks must cover each
  action's new neighbours, so the order belongs in `scripts/ur5_tip_calibration_plan.py` (an option such as
  `--order joint6`), with the grid's reference presses kept at their places in time. A new plan then runs in the
  simulator.

  Amended 19:44: the gravity sweeps go out and back, and only the pad and grid stages are sorted. Out and back means
  every other station, in order of joint 6, on the way out and the rest on the way back. For the 12 stations of
  `gravity` that is 559 deg of travel, against 959 deg in plan order and 285 deg sorted. When the stations are
  sorted, the direction of gravity changes in step with time, and a drift term (R6) is then poorly separated from the
  gravity map. With 5 mN of noise, the 1-sigma of the map's columns is 2.66 mN per g in plan order, 3.68 sorted and
  2.72 out and back.

  Implemented at 19:59 in `scripts/ur5_tip_calibration_plan.py`: `--order joint6`, and `--gravity-roll-offset 30`, which
  turns every gravity station's roll by 30 deg. Without the offset, two stations sit half a turn from the homing pose
  (grav-03 at +182 deg and grav-13 at -178 deg), where the robot's IK may take either side; the first run's 285 deg
  turn came from there. Built here with this cell's options from `lab/README.md` plus both new ones:

  | Stage | Travel in plan order (deg) | Travel ordered (deg) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Gravity, 13 stations | 1319 | 600 |
  | Pad, 32 | 1335 | 123 |
  | Grid, 74 | 995 | 499 |
  | Final gravity, 5 stations | 658 | 480 |
  | Shear, roll, twist | 340 | 340 |

  The plan has 157 actions, 4 dropped and no travel path short of clearance. With the offset, grav-08 and fgrav-04
  reach, and grav-11 and fgrav-05 do not. The grid's reference presses stay at places 0, 16, 32, 48, 64 and 73 of 74.
  The final sweep has 5 stations, one short of the program's fit, so it is checked here against the first fit. In the
  default order, the plan's list now follows the session's order of execution, all rolls before all twists. The
  builder used to interleave them, so its travel checks did not cover the transitions that the session makes. The
  gravity check now solves each station nearest the homing branch, as the program does. A full simulated session on
  this plan runs here now.

- R4 (in progress at 19:52: the owner found the connector itself loose and is tightening its coupling ring; the owner,
  before the next run). Test the HEX-E's cable on the robot. The dropouts began at joint 6
  = 69.0 deg turning at +5.1 deg/s and at 23.5 deg turning at -6.9 deg/s. Both angles lie inside the span of the
  presses, and both came mid-turn. That fits a connection that opens when the cable moves, more than a cable drawn
  tight at one end of the span. Reseat both connectors of the cable and relieve its strain at the sensor. Then, with
  the program stopped, turn joint 6 from -180 to +170 deg and back three times at 10 deg/s, 150 mm above the
  indenter, while one reader logs the stream. It passes with no gap over 100 ms and no counter restart.

- R5 (open, 19:38; the owner, when at the robot, not blocking). Check the HEX-E's force gain with a known mass. Its
  raw zero is at about 645 N on a 200 N sensor, and the analysis takes every force from its gain. Run the gravity
  stage twice, with a mass of 100 to 200 g (weighed to 0.1 g) taped to the mount and without it:
  `tipcal_run.sh gainA --stages preflight,homing,gravity`, then `gainB`. The change of the fitted weight against
  m g gives the gain to about 1 %.

- R6 (done by the lab in c26c65f9, 19:52; it had been asked at 19:44). Fit the HEX-E's drift during the sweep. With the
  arm still, `lab/sensor_watch.py` measured the untared Fz creeping 0.4 N in 5 min, 0.08 N/min. That drift was added
  along the sensor's z to the gravity records of the simulated session 151114-sim, and the plain fit was biased:

  | Sweep | Residual, plain fit (mN) | Map A off, plain fit | Weight off, plain fit | Residual, with drift term (mN) | Map A off, with drift term |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Full speed, 94 s | 19.1 | 1.3 % | 0.6 % | 4.0 | 0.3 % |
  | 30 % speed, 243 s | 50.3 | 3.3 % | 1.6 % | 4.0 | 0.3 % |

  A is the HEX-E's map from the flange frame, and every force of the analysis goes through it. The drift term is one
  more column in the fit: the force reads A g_E + o_f + v (t - t_mean), with t each record's time (`rec["t"]`, already
  stored) and v the drift per axis, reported in N/min. The torques take the same column. With the term, the residual
  is again a test for cables pulling on the tool, and Table 2's 0.02 N applies to it. The final sweep has 4
  orientations in this plan and gets no fit, because the program needs 6. Its changes between orientations are
  compared with the first fit's prediction on the workstation instead.

The Writing section of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/writing_reference.md` went to the lab session in three
messages at 19:45; the lab confirmed them at 19:58.
